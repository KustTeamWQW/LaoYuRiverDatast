# LaoYuRiverDatast
 the LaoYu River dataset was collected by OHS satellite over Dianchi Lake and its adjacent LaoYu River wetland parks. In this area, a large number of Metasequoias have been planted along Dianchi Lake, which play a crucial role in purifying the water quality of Dianchi Lake and protecting the ecological environment. The dataset consists of 391 × 591 pixels with the spatial resolution of 10 m. The wavelength range of the LaoYu River dataset is 0.4 to 1µm. After removing the disturbing bands, the remaining 32 spectral bands in the dataset are labeled into 8 different classes for further analysis and experimentation.
